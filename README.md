I have worked on and learnt through php and jQuery how the basic chatroom is created as data is retrieved to the user and stored in the database for any further actions.
Here are the following process that are involved as: 
1. Accessing Bootstrap
2. Adding Bootstrap Template
3. Editing the Template
4. Adding Input Method - Create Room
5. Validation Checks 
6. Creating claim.php File
7. Getting the value of Post Parameter
8. Connection to the Database
9. Creating db_Connect.php file
10. Creating database Connection
11. Checking Connection
12. Creating Chat Room Database
13. Validation Check - Room already Exists
14. Creating Rooms.php
15. Connecting to the Database
16. Creating and Executing the SQL query
